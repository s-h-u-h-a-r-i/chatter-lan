### Theme Guidelines:

- Use color variables exclusively from: [\_colors.css](/src/styles/_colors.css)
- Import all CSS and apply default element styles in: [index.css](/src/styles/index.css)

### Project Structure Guidelines:

- Place feature-specific logic in `/src/app/pages/`
- Place universally shareable logic in `/src/lib/`
- Organize feature logic further within `/src/app/pages/[feature]/components/` or `/src/app/pages/[feature]/types/`
- Put reusable generic components in `/src/components/`
- Store global application state in `/src/store/`

### Code Quality & Refactoring Guidelines:

- **Consider architectural improvements**: Don't just match existing patterns—suggest improvements that prevent future issues
- **Think ahead**: Consider edge cases and potential conflicts
- **Prefer abstraction**: When multiple similar patterns exist, suggest generic or abstract solutions that reduce duplication
- **Balance simplicity with robustness**: Simple code is good, but not at the expense of type safety or maintainability
